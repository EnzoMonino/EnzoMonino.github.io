Welcome!

My name is Enzo Monino, I am a post-doc in the group of [Libor Veis](http://libor.veisovi.com/) at the [J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry](https://jh-inst.cas.cz/) in Prague (Czech Republic). I did my Ph.D. in the group of [Pierre-François Loos](https://pfloos.github.io/WEB_LOOS/) at the [Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques](https://www.lcpq.ups-tlse.fr/?lang=en) in Toulouse (France).

I have studied theoretical chemistry and modeling at the University of Montpellier in the south of France. During my master, I had the opportunity to do two internships. The first one was about the computation of bound states of the $\text{HeH}_2^+$ complex using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) approach. The second one was about orbital relaxation in the context of molecular electronic transition computations.

My Ph.D. thesis is entitled **Green’s function methods for charged and neutral excitations** where I apply some well-known approximations (second-Born, $GT$, and $GW$) to compute those excitations in molecules. In this thesis, I also explore some of the features of these methods like discontinuities in physical quantities (and their origins) as well as the connections between these methods.

I am mainly interested in electronic structure methods based on perturbation theory (but not only) with a focus on excited states.  I am also one of the developers of the [qcmath](https://github.com/LCPQ/qcmath/) software that is based on the [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) environment. It aims to help newcomers in quantum chemistry easily to develop their ideas thanks to the powerful symbolic nature of Mathematica.
